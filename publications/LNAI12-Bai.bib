  abstract= {The RoboCup soccer simulation 2D domain is a very large
  testbed for the research of planning and machine learning. It has competed
  in the annual world championship tournaments in the past 15
  years. However it is still unclear that whether more principled techniques
  such as decision-theoretic planning take an important role in the success
  for a RoboCup 2D team. In this paper, we present a novel approach
  based on MAXQ-OP to automated planning in the RoboCup 2D domain.
  It combines the benefits of a general hierarchical structure based
  on MAXQ value function decomposition with the power of heuristic and
  approximate techniques. The proposed framework provides a principled
  solution to programming autonomous agents in large stochastic domains.
  The MAXQ-OP framework has been implemented in our RoboCup 2D
  team, WrightEagle. The empirical results indicated that the agents
  developed with this framework and related techniques reached outstanding
  performances, showing its potential of scalability to very large domains.
