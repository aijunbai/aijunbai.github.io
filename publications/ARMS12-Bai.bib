  abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide an expressive
  framework for planning in stochastic domains. However, exactly solving
  a large MDP is often intractable due to the curse of dimensionality.
  Online algorithms help overcome the high computational complexity by
  avoiding computing a policy for each possible state. Hierarchical 
  decomposition is another promising way to help scale MDP algorithms up to
  large domains by exploiting their underlying structure. In this paper,
  we present an effort on combining the benefits of a general hierarchical
  structure based on MAXQ value function decomposition with the
  power of heuristic and approximate techniques for developing an online
  planning framework, called MAXQ-OP. The proposed framework provides
  a principled approach for programming autonomous agents in a
  large stochastic domain. We empirically evaluated our algorithm on the
  Taxi problem¨Ca common benchmark for MAXQ¨Cto show the efficiency of
  MAXQ-OP. We have also been conducting a long-term case-study with
  the RoboCup soccer simulation 2D domain, which is extremely larger
  than domains usually studied in the literature, as the major benchmark
  to this research. The case-study showed that the agents developed with
  this framework and the related techniques reached outstanding performances,
  showing its high scalability to very large domains.
