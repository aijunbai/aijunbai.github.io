    The RoboCup simulation league is traditionally the league with the largest
    number of teams participating, both at the international competitions and
    worldwide.  2011 was no exception, with a total of 39 teams entering the 2{D}
    and 3D simulation competitions.  This paper presents the champions of the
    competitions, WrightEagle from the University of Science and Technology of
    China in the 2{D} competition, and UT Austin Villa from the University of
    Texas at Austin in the 3D competition.
