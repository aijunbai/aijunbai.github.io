ABSTRACT="The ability for an information-fusion system to track and identify
potentially multiple objects in a dynamic environment is essential for many
applications, such as automated surveillance, traffic monitoring,
human-robot interaction, etc. The main challenge is due to the noisy and
incomplete perception including inevitable false negative and false
positive errors, usually originated from some low-level sensors or
detectors. To address this challenge, we propose a novel particle filtering
over sets based approach to multi-object tracking and identification. We
model the multi-object tracking problem as a hidden Markov model with
states and observations represented as finite sets. We then develop motion
and observation functions accordingly, and do the inference via particle
filtering. The corresponding object identification problem is then
formulated and solved by using the expectation-maximization method. The set
formulation enables us to avoid directly performing observation-to-object
association. We empirically confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms
the state-of-the-art in a popular PETS dataset."
