    The RoboCup simulation league is traditionally the league with the largest
    number of teams participating, both at the international competitions and
    worldwide.  2011 was no exception, with a total of 39 teams entering the 2D
    and 3D simulation competitions.  This paper presents the champions of the
    competitions, WrightEagle from the University of Science and Technology of
    China in the 2D competition, and UT Austin Villa from the University of
    Texas at Austin in the 3D competition.
